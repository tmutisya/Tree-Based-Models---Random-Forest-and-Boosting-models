# Tree-Based-Models---Random-Forest-and-Boosting-models
Tree-based models use hierarchical decision rules to capture complex, non-linear relationships and interactions among variables. They often achieve better results than linear models because they automatically handle feature interactions and nonlinearity, leading to higher predictive accuracy and robustness in real-world, complex datasets.
